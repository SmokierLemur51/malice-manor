# malice-manor

Malice Manor is a simulated dark net market that is based on Harry Potter lore. 

I am creating it as a means to deep dive into a few things I am very passionate about:

    - The Tor Project
    - Web Development
    - Harry Potter

While also learning how to securely implement a django project. I hope to one day 
feel confident enough in this project to turn it into a CTF to teach people how to 
attack and defend servers.
