# malice-manor

Malice Manor is a simulated dark net market that is based on Harry Potter lore. 

## What is the Purpose? 

To preface, I am working on geting my CompTIA Security +, then I will pursue the CCNA, and slowly work my way towards the OSCP. I think that learning how to build, secure, and penetrate systems will be very important. So I am building this darknet market for wizards as a CTF, in the hopes that I can build a community to test me. 

I plan to use the web development skills I learn to try and gather some freelance development clients.
